## Installation

Assuming you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as your package mananger you can basically just `npm install` all packages. <br>
Otherwise we also provide [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds for each package within the `dist` folder. You can easily use them via [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com/).
> **Caution**: You need to include both Inferno and Fela on your own as well.

There you will also find some usage examples. This package only contains the pure API reference documentation.
